  %h3 What is this?
  %p!== Instead of creating yet another username and password, #{config.site_name} will use the account you select above. If you don't see your institution or a social identity provider that you want to use, you may have an OpenID you can use from another service such as Flickr, Blogger, or WordPress.com account - click the OpenID logo and then the icon for the corresponding service, and it well help you find out your OpenID URL.
  %br
  %h3 Do I have to give you my password?
  %p!== <strong>No.</strong> After entering your info above, you will be taken to the service that you picked and enter your password there. Then you will be asked to approve #{config.site_name} to have limited access to basic information like your username and email address. Finally you will be redirected back here to finish signing up. <strong>We will never have access to your passwords or your accounts.</strong>
  %h2 Why should I sign up?
  Once you sign up or sign in using the form to the left, you'll be able to:
  %ul{ :style => 'margin-left:30px;' }
    %li Edit documents
    %li Submit documents for publication
    %li Publish new documents
    %li Collaborate with other users

:javascript
  jQuery(document).ready(
    function() {
      browser_test();
    }
  );
